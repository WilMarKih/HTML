        <h4>Verse 1</h4>
    <pre>
        We dont believe whats on TV, 
        Because it's what we want to think,
        And what we think we know we cant believe,
        We have all learned to kill our dreams, 
    </pre>
    <h4>Hook</h4>
    <pre>
        I used to know,
        That when i die, you'll still be here, oh, 
        Cause if you stick around, 
        I'll  turn on a pretty sound, 
        and make money selling your hair, 
    </pre>
    <h4>
       Chorus
    </h4>
    <pre>
        I dont care whats in your head, 
        Im just worried on whats on your mind, 
        I used to say that i want to die before im old 
        But because of you, i want to change my mind 
    </pre>
